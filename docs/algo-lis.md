# Longest Increasing Subsequence with Scala
## Common description
## Implementation idea
### General design for solution class
### Data structure to iterate over solution search
### Recursive subsequence scan
### Solution set increment
#### With direct O(n*n) time complexity
#### Improvement with O(n*log(n)) time complexity
