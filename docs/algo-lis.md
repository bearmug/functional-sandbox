# Longest Increasing Subsequence with Scala
## Common description
[Ignition article]
(http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-3-longest-increasing-subsequence/)
## Implementation idea
### General design for solution class
### Data structure to iterate over solution search
### Recursive subsequence scan
### Solution set increment
#### With direct O(n*n) time complexity
#### Improvement with O(n*log(n)) time complexity
